# Biostatistics-Portfolio
Personal data analysis projects developed or projects from MPH course work to demonstrate beginner-level technical proficiency in R, SQL, SAS and poteionally other languages . These projects reflect foundational skills in data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and public health insights. They are actively being refined and expanded as I progress through my MPH in Biostatistics at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health.
