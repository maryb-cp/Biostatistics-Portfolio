#Step 1: Set Working Directory
setwd("C:/Users/mboat/OneDrive/covid_trend_Project")

#Step 2: Load Required Packages
library(tidyverse)

#Step 3: Import the COVID-19 Dataset
covid_data <- read.csv("owid-covid-data.csv.csv")

#Step 4: Preview and Understand the Data
head(covid_data)
colnames(covid_data)

# Step 5: Filter Data for US, India, and Brazil (2022 and beyond)
covid_selected <- covid_data %>%
  filter(location %in% c("United States", "India", "Brazil"),

#cleaning data; removing all 0 and missing values

  filter(!is.na(new_cases), new_cases != 0)

#converting date column from a character to a proper Date format,

# Step 6: Create Line Graph of Daily New Cases with ggplot2
